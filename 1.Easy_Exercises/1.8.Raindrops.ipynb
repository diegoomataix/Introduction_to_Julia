    "Your task is to convert a number into a string that contains raindrop sounds corresponding to certain potential factors. A factor is a number that evenly divides into another number, leaving no remainder. The simplest way to test if a one number is a factor of another is to use the modulo operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules of raindrops are that if a given number:\n",
    "\n",
    "    has 3 as a factor, add 'Pling' to the result.\n",
    "    has 5 as a factor, add 'Plang' to the result.\n",
    "    has 7 as a factor, add 'Plong' to the result.\n",
    "    does not have any of 3, 5, or 7 as a factor, the result should be the digits of the number.\n",

    "Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "    28 has 7 as a factor, but not 3 or 5, so the result would be \"Plong\".\n",
    "    30 has both 3 and 5 as factors, but not 7, so the result would be \"PlingPlang\".\n",
    "    34 is not factored by 3, 5, or 7, so the result would be \"34\".\n"
